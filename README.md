# UFC Champions Analysis
This project visualises the number of wins of current UFC Champions over the current top 15 of their respective divisions. I will use BS4 to scrape the data from two different webistes: 
  1) ufc.com/rankings -> to extract name of current champion as well as the top 15 of their division
  2) wikipedia -> to extract the Professional MMA record for the current champion

I will use matplotlib to create a bar chart showing how many fighters each champion has beaten of the currently ranked top 15 fighters in their division.
